## The Dragon's Flagon

A website for our D&D group where the DM will share campaign info and goodies and players can share pics and descitptions about their characters. We can also add things like: calendar of when we play, potluck planning, general random D&D related (or unrelated) features you feel like coding.
 
## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This is a pretty simple React app and liekly we will not need to eject it, so follow the CRA and React docs to do add features.

## App Architecture
 - Sass support (TODO)
 - Bootstrap added (TODO)
